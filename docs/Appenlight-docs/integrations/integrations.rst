Integrations Overview
=====================

Each application that you connect to |RAE| can have its alerts and reports
fed to one of the supported 3rd party applications. You can set notification
rules so that only the reports and events that you deem relevant trigger an
action. To integrate with any of these, use the following steps:

1. From the |RAE| interface, click through to the
   :menuselection:`Settings --> List applications --> Integrations` page for
   your chosen application.
2. Enter the required integration details. You will usually get these details
   from your 3rd party application admin account.
3. If necessary, on your 3rd party application account, enable the |RAE|
   integration using whatever requirements are needed on their end.
